Hi, Welcome to my GitHub Page!

I'm Suren Sughand, a 27-year-old Data enthusiast. Innovative and results-driven Data Architect and Analytics Professional with a Master's in Information Technology and Analytics from Rutgers University and a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from the University of Mumbai. As a Technical Architect at Tata Consultancy Services Limited, I specialize in transforming raw data into strategic insights, utilizing SQL, Python, and Tableau to drive operational efficiency and enhance customer satisfaction.

In my current role, I lead data mining initiatives, design interactive Tableau dashboards, and collaborate with business users to define requirements, providing both technical and non-technical solutions. Proficient in Python, I develop scripts for seamless integration of Informatica Transformations into Teradata queries, ensuring error-free database operations.

As an Assistant Professor at Rutgers University, I contributed to shaping future tech leaders, leading courses, conducting lab sessions, and providing effective feedback. My commitment to education aligns with my passion for data science, demonstrated through projects like the Colgate Data Science Challenge, where I developed an ML regression model using XGBoost and won the First Prize in the HACK RU hackathon.

My diverse skill set includes expertise in database systems such as Teradata, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, analytics tools like Informatica, Power BI, and Jenkins, and proficiency in R programming for data analysis and visualization. I have successfully migrated substantial datasets to AWS for enhanced security and scalability, implementing data warehousing techniques and automating ETL pipelines.

Projects like FIFA'19 Analysis & Visualization, Twitter Sentiment Analysis, and Apple Stock Price Forecasting showcase my ability to apply regression models, machine learning, and data cleansing techniques to real-world scenarios. My published research and track record in achieving 87% accuracy in time series modeling underscore my dedication to excellence in the dynamic field of data science.

Eager to connect with like-minded professionals, collaborate on innovative projects, and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of information technology and analytics. Let's explore possibilities at the intersection of data, technology, and innovation.
